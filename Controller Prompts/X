This mostly consists of extra prompts made by Lars Doucet (larsiusprime), whilst the GCW prompts were made by "congusbongus", both deriving from ZIP files found in the comments of the OGA post of Xelu's prompts (https://opengameart.org/content/free-keyboard-and-controllers-prompts-pack)

They are all licensed under CC0, so use them for whatever needs you have. No one'll stop ya.

P.S.: Hi Lars and Xelu!
